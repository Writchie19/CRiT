# Compost, Recycle, or Trash? (CRiT?)

A new flutter project we have started to implement a brilliant idea for an application that the infamous Daniel Ritchie has come up with during the UC Davis Hackathon. 

## The idea

The idea is to have an app that where the user can scan a barcode of an item, and determine whether the object belongs in: Compost, Recycle, or the Trash.  The idea involves deveoping a growing database of items bases on people input as to where the object belongs

## Note: This is a work in progress and even though there is a release don't use the code quite yet

## Future Work
includes applying computer vision to replace barcode scanning (this solves the obvious compost? problem)

### P.S.  The mis-spelling is intentional, bonus points if you know why
